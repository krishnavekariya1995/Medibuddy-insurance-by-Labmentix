        "The MediBuddy Insurance Data Analysis & Risk Assessment project aims to understand the key factors that influence medical insurance charges and to provide data-driven insights that can support better decision-making in insurance policy design and risk management. MediBuddy, being a digital healthcare and insurance platform, deals with diverse customer profiles varying in age, health status, lifestyle, and demographics. This project leverages cleaned and structured insurance data to analyze how these factors impact insurance claim amounts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project includes information such as policy number, age, age group, gender, region, number of children (dependents), smoking status, BMI (Body Mass Index), BMI category, and insurance charges in INR. Since the data was already cleaned prior to analysis, the focus of the project was on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization rather than preprocessing. Feature engineering, such as creating age groups and BMI categories, helped in simplifying analysis and drawing more meaningful insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis followed a structured UBM approach (Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis) to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the data. Univariate analysis was used to study the distribution of individual variables like age group, BMI, and insurance charges. These analyses revealed that most policyholders belong to young adult, adult, and middle-aged categories, while senior citizens form a smaller proportion of the insured population. BMI distribution showed that most individuals fall within the normal to overweight range, indicating a generally moderate health risk profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bivariate analysis examined relationships between two variables at a time, such as age and insurance charges, BMI and insurance charges, number of dependents and charges, and smoking status versus charges. These visualizations clearly indicated that insurance charges increase with age and BMI. Smoking status emerged as one of the most influential factors, with smokers consistently incurring significantly higher insurance costs than non-smokers across all comparisons. In contrast, the number of dependents showed only a marginal impact on insurance charges, suggesting it is not a major cost driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multivariate analysis further strengthened these findings by examining combined effects of multiple variables. Visualizations such as grouped bar charts, box plots, heatmaps, and bubble charts demonstrated that the interaction between age, BMI, and smoking status leads to substantially higher insurance charges. Senior individuals with obese BMI and smoking habits represented the highest-risk group. Heatmap analysis highlighted that insurance charges rise sharply when higher age groups intersect with unhealthy BMI categories. Bubble chart analysis reinforced that smoking amplifies the combined effect of age and BMI on insurance costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the project concludes that age, BMI, and smoking status are the most critical factors influencing insurance charges, while gender, region, and number of dependents play comparatively smaller roles. These insights are highly valuable for insurance companies like MediBuddy, as they can be used to design risk-based premium structures, introduce targeted wellness programs, and offer incentives or discounts for healthier individuals. The findings also support the idea of personalized and preventive healthcare-driven insurance models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this project demonstrates how data visualization and exploratory analysis can uncover meaningful patterns in insurance data, enabling smarter business decisions and improved risk assessment in the healthcare insurance domain."

        "The objective of this project is to analyze MediBuddy insurance data to understand how different demographic, health, and lifestyle factors influence insurance charges, based strictly on insights derived from data visualizations. The analysis focuses on identifying key risk drivers by examining patterns observed in charts related to age groups, BMI distribution, smoking status, number of dependents, and their combined effects on insurance charges. From the visual evidence, insurance costs show a consistent increase with age, higher BMI categories, and smoking behavior, while factors such as gender and number of dependents exhibit limited influence. By relying solely on the outcomes observed in the provided charts, this project aims to highlight which customer segments contribute most to higher insurance claims and to support data-driven decision-making for risk assessment, premium structuring, and targeted policy design within the MediBuddy insurance framework."

Smoking status emerged as one of the most critical factors, with smokers incurring substantially higher insurance costs than non-smokers. In contrast, gender and number of dependents showed minimal impact on insurance charges.

The analysis revealed that age, BMI, and smoking status significantly influence insurance costs, with higher values leading to increased claims. Customers with multiple risk factors contribute disproportionately to overall insurance expenditure. In contrast, gender and number of dependents showed minimal impact on insurance charges. These insights support a risk-based pricing approach and encourage preventive health initiatives. Overall, the project enables data-driven decision-making for sustainable growth and improved risk management."
